1. How much time you spent on the assignment
    - 6 to 7 hours

2. Assignment problem areas (if there weren't any then just say 'none')
    - I had an interesting problem when it came to testing my ClockShop. When I would run the tests, it seemed to be duplicate
      the first item that filled the list. This didn't happen when I ran the code on my own separate from the unit tests.
      It turned out that it was remembering a value from one test to the other so it maintained values in the clock list
      across tests. There's something about the way that you declare variables in the constructor that can raise the scope
      of the variables. I'm still not understanding how this works.

    - I'm still learning python syntax and I'm a little rusty in coding, so this took longer than I thought it should have

3. Any shortcomings your solution has (if there aren't any then just say 'none')
    - There are a lot of edge cases that I don't account for in my code. If I was actually using this in some application,
      I would have to make sure the data was coming in clean and as expected.
