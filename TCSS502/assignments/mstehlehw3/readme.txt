1. How much time you spent on the assignment
    - 5-6 hours

2. Assignment problem areas (if there weren't any then just say 'none')
    - I'm still learning python syntax, and I know I could have made my setEnemies method much prettier
      and more efficient.

    - I was honestly confused for a long time how everything was supposed to work together, which delayed
      me significantly.

4. Extra Credit
    - Created Observer as an Abstract Base Class (ABC)

3. Any shortcomings your solution has (if there aren't any then just say 'none')
    - There are a lot of edge cases that I don't account for in my code. If I was actually using this in some application,
      I would have to make sure the data was coming in clean and as expected. I would also make some of these
      methods (like setEnemies) much better. It repeats too much and could be more efficient.
