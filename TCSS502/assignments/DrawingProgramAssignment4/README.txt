# README: Assignment 4
### Team Members: Danielle Moreau & Madison Stehle

____

1. Time it took each person to work on assignment: over 9,000 (* Feels like it. it's hard to track how long it really took per person, but we collaborated and worked hard on this for a week)


2. What each person worked on: It was a team effort and collaboration. A google collab was created and as each member progressed, successful code was added. Unittests were broken down and Danielle and Madison took their own functions to complete. merge_sort/sort_shapes was a collaboration as Danielle made the initial merge_sort algo, and Madison implemented it into the shape program.


3. Any shortcomings/concerns you have with the state of the program: It would have been helpful if unittests were gone over a little bit in lectures prior to the homework, however it wasn't overly difficult to figure out as we referenced Clockshop tests.


4. Any questions you have for Varik: None
