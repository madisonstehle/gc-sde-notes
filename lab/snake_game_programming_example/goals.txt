Some goals for the game:

1. Change the movement system to be similar to snake (e.g. constant movement with wasd changing direction) (hard)
1. Somehow animate the player's movement (requires creativity)
2. Make it so that the player can die by hitting walls, change the sprite to a different emoji (skull emoji maybe?) (easy)
DONE 3. Make collecting apples increase your points and write the points to the console using world.ui (easy)
4. Make collecting apples increase the size of the snake. Snake pieces must follow player object which will be the head (hard)
5. Make a game over screen (e.g. destroy all objects in the world and replace them with something else) (medium)
5.a Allow the player to restart the game (medium)
6. Make the player press a button to start the game (easy)
DONE 7. Make it so that Apples randomly appear around the map (easy)
7.a Make it so that Apples can never appear on top of other objects (medium)
7.b Make it so that if there is no place for an Apple to spawn the player wins (medium)
